1st Disclaimer: The Default Config is set to fit the Bending Masters Server, it is much faster paced and would not be in any way balanced in the default Config of PK. Configure it to your liking. You can likely add an extra 0 to Cooldown everywhere and be fine though.
  
  2nd Disclaimer: I do not know how to code properly. I can read it and do some edits. Feel free to PR stuff.

3rd Disclaimer: It's likely I don't make everything configurable, just create an issue of anything you want to be configurable, I'll eventually get to it.
